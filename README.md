## Hi there âœ¨

My name is Erin (she/hers) and I am currently studying Computer Science and Cybersecurity. 

As I approach the end of my undergraduate studies, I am looking to expand my technical skillset by taking on more complex projects and immersing myself in meaningful discussions about the future of software development and online security.
